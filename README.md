# Take a Hike!

#### An app to match hikers to fellow hikers and trails based on trail features and, in Phase 2, match hikers to potential hiking partners.

#### By **Marguerite Kennedy, Maya Frame and Kevin Garvey**

## Description

Epicodus C#/.NET group project, to be presented on *Thursday, May 23, 2019*.

Our ultimate vision is to create an app to connect people interested in finding hikes and co-hikers. In the initial phase, we'll match hikers to hikes, based in data in our (admittedly small) database of trails near Seattle, WA.

In Phase 2, we hope to match hikers based on mutual interests and other filters. Thus, we'd have a list of desired features for TRAILS, and a list of features for HIKERS, and the match would be based on the intersection of desired criteria.

### Specs

Minimum Viable Product: Match users to hikes based on desired hike features in our database(e.g., distance, elevation, dog-friendly, difficulty level...), and return a list of trails that fit their criteria, and other users who share similar interests.

User Story 1: Manpreet is looking to go on a hike somewhere within 15 miles of downtown Seattle after work on Wednesday. It'll be late, so he wants to hike no more than 5 miles, but any difficulty level is fine.

//Also, he doesn't have a car, so if he could find someone who has one, that would be great. Any gender is fine. In the initial phase, users will have to contact each other directly to set up hikes with potentially interested members.

#### Further Buildout: Phase 2++

 User Story 2: Hike "Host": Maria wants go hiking on Saturday. She has a car and is willing to provide transportation for a fellow hiker. She also has a dog. Because she doesn't know everyone in the group and has a strong preference for not being murdered in the woods, she prefers hiking with another woman/femme person. She creates a hike "event" in the app, which will be visible to other users who meet her criteria.

Desired eventual functionality:

- A hike "host" can propose/create an event on a specific date and time range, including desired distance from Seattle and features of hikes, as well as transportation offered/needed, dogs welcome and/or host is bringing a dog, etc.  

- Users can create a profile and enter personal criteria such as gender, can provide transportation, has dog, preferred difficulty level, etc.  The app would match users to other hikers whose hiking interests are compatible, further filtered by the personal attributes of the other users (gender, has transportation, has dog, etc.).

- The Host of a hike can create a specific filter to make their proposed hike visible to other users based on various attributes like a user's gender, hiking ability, and interests.

- A host would be able users can see their proposed hike, but users won't necessarily know who else can or can't see it. So, if you can see someone's proposed hike, you know they are potentially interested in hiking with you.

- Establishing a specific date and time of a hike that other users can respond to or join. In the initial iteration, user/personal features such as "has dog" or "has transportation" will be fixed, with the goal of that being something users can opt into once a hike "event" is created.
